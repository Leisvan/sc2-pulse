# How to contribute
## Places for contribution
Github issues is the place for any kind of contribution:
* Feature request
* Bug report
* Question

You are welcome to contribute in any way you like (including code).

## Development lifecycle
Every major version has its own github project where all relevant issues are residing.
After the project start, new feature requests will be moved to the next project.
Bug reports are going into the currently active project.

## Branches
* master: *public*, *protected*. Stable branch, the code will be merged here 
after the major release development lifecycle is over. Accepting only critical bug fixes.
* major version(x.x.x): *public*. Current development branch. Accepting any kind of PR.
Can be rewritten in a very rare occasion. This is what you want most of the time.
* feat-\*/fix-\*: *private*, *volatile*. Private branch for some major(usually) change. This branch
can(and most likely will) be rewritten multiple times, so this is a wrong branch to base your work of.

## Code contribution requirements
No level of competence required, I am learning how to create some web apps here, so can you.
Here is a list of basic rules you must follow:
* Like/play StarCraft&reg;2. You must understand what info a SC2 player would like to see. 
* Your code must pass all the tests, including integration tests
* Squash/fixup relevant commits before creating a PR

## Code style
* Newline braces
* 4 spaces indentation

## Most wanted contributions
### Frontend 
My front end code and expertise are an absolute garbage, so I welcome any contribution to make front end great(again). 

Here are some points to consider:
* All code can be rewritten from the scratch if needed
* The UI should be as simple as possible, as there is a lot of info on the screen
* Modern frameworks are welcome

## Good first issue
If you are new to programming, wait for an issue with the `good first issue` label to pop up and try to solve it.
