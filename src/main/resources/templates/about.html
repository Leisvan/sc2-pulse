                    <dd>This project links real pro players to their ladder accounts. It also has a lot of meta info,
                        such as social media links, online streams, etc.. Help this project to identify ladder accounts, and
                        that info will also show up here.<br/>
                        This site uses sc2revealed.com data to get pro player stats and unmask the barcodes.</dd>
                    <dt><a href="http://aligulac.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aligulac</a></dt>
                    <dd>An open source project about pro scene. Features custom rating, events, match results, total earnings and more.
                        Absolutely amazing resource. It also has a DB dump if you want to run some queries.<br/>
                        This site uses aligulac.com data to get more info about pro players.</dd>
                    <dt><a href="https://www.rankedftw.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rankedftw</a></dt>
                    <dd>One of THE original stats sites. It was(and still is) the place to go after the sc2ranks.com shutdown.
                        The core feature is a team rank progression throughout the seasons, which was priceless during the pre MMR era.
                        The project is open source too! Check it out.</dd>
                    <dt><a href="https://sc2replaystats.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sc2replaystats</a></dt>
                    <dd>A different take on stats aggregation. It uses replay files submitted by users, which gives an access to
                        numerous interesting stats that are not available via the standard API.</dd>
                    <dt><a href="https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">liquipedia</a></dt>

                    API endpoints are pretty self explanatory, there are no special params or hidden points, anything
                    you can use is already used by the website, so grab whatever data you like. Just be reasonable with
                    your request rate.
